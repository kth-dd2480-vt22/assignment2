## Overview
This project is a basic CI-server written in Java. The server is configured for Github-webhooks,
to automatically test a repository each time a new push event occurs.

##Functionality

##How to use

##Team
Currently, we've identified ourselves being in the state of 'Performance'. This means that the team is meeting its commitments,
continuously adapting to changing contexts, as well as identifying and addressing problems without outside help. The work
is efficient with minimal rework, and because of clear and recurring meetings we are avoiding unnecessary rework/wasted work.
Everyone on the team is taking responsibility for their own work and making sure that internal deadlines are met. If any team member
is stuck on any particular issue, the team is notified and a solution is created together.
